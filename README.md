## Q&A:

Will Codespaces be available for Open Source development? Currently I use gitpod.io/ for most of my OSS development.
For GitHub Free accounts GitHub Codespaces is officially in Beta while the service is General Available for Teams and Enterprise accounts.
The service for the free account is the same but the Beta status indicates that there is some planning going on how to offer the service for free accounts. Currently we have nothing to announce.
